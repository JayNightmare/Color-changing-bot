# Color-changing-bot
This bot changes color of a discord user by using HEX color codes

Required information for the bot:
- The bot token
- User ID

I've left a comment in the code where you can add more commands. Add it as an IF statement!

Code is open source for you to use however you see fit. No need for credit or such :D
